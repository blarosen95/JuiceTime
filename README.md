NOTICE: Nicotine is readily absorbed through the physique and is extremely toxic in concentrated forms. The LD50 for dermal contact with nicotine is lower than that of both cyanide and arsenic. Always handle nicotine concentrates with caution and follow all recommended safety procedures. For a full list of precautions please see the MSDS provided by your nicotine supplier. If your supplier does not keep an MSDS for the nicotine that you purchase, I would advise that you buy from a different company. I am not responsible for any resulting injuries, illnesses, or deaths due to the misuse of this software or due to the improper handling of ANY chemical substance.
